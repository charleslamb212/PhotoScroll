# PhotoScroll - Smooth Image Gallery Scrolling

**PhotoScroll** is a JavaScript code snippet that enables a smooth scrolling effect for an image gallery. This effect is achieved by cleverly using mouse movement to scroll through images horizontally. When the user clicks and drags the mouse, the images smoothly transition, creating an engaging gallery browsing experience.

## How it Works

PhotoScroll works by utilizing JavaScript to manipulate the transformation and object position of the images within an HTML element. Here's a breakdown of the key components in the code:

### HTML Structure

The code assumes the presence of an HTML element with the ID "image-track" that contains a series of images. These images represent the gallery items that will be scrolled.

````html
<div id="image-track">
  <!-- Your gallery images go here -->
</div>
```
````

## JavaScript Functions

The JavaScript code includes three main event handlers:

### handleOnDown(e):

This function is triggered when the user clicks (mousedown) or touches (touchstart) the mouse. It records the initial mouse position.

### handleOnUp():

This function is called when the user releases the mouse button (mouseup) or touch (touchend). It resets the mouse position and stores the previous scroll percentage.

### handleOnMove(e):

This function is responsible for calculating the scroll percentage based on mouse movement and applying smooth animations to both the "image-track" and individual images.

## Touch Event Handling

The code also includes event handlers for touch events to ensure compatibility with touch-enabled devices. These handlers mirror the mouse events and allow users to scroll through the gallery using touch gestures.

## Usage

To use PhotoScroll in your project:

Include the HTML structure with the "image-track" element containing your gallery images.

Add the JavaScript code to your project.

Make sure to include the necessary event listeners for mouse and touch events, as shown in the code.

Customize the code as needed to fit the styling and behavior of your image gallery.
